## 🚜 Overview

AgriGS-SLAM is a Visual–LiDAR SLAM framework designed for robust real-time 3D mapping and reconstruction in agricultural orchards. The system couples direct LiDAR odometry and loop closures with multi-camera 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) rendering to handle the unique challenges of orchard environments, including repetitive row geometry, seasonal appearance changes, and wind-driven foliage motion.

## 📝 Abstract

Autonomous robots in orchards require real-time
3D scene understanding despite repetitive row geometry, seasonal appearance changes, and wind-driven foliage motion. We present AgriGS-SLAM, a Visual–LiDAR SLAM framework that couples direct LiDAR odometry and loop closures with multi-camera 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) rendering. Batch rasterization across complementary viewpoints recovers orchard structure under occlusions, while a unified gradientdriven map lifecycle executed between keyframes preserves fine details and bounds memory. Pose refinement is guided by a probabilistic LiDAR-based depth consistency term, backpropagated through the camera projection to tighten geometryappearance coupling. We deploy the system on a field platform in apple and pear orchards across dormancy, flowering, and harvesting, using a standardized trajectory protocol that evaluates both training-view and novel-view synthesis to reduce 3DGS overfitting in evaluation. Across seasons and sites, AgriGS-SLAM delivers sharper, more stable reconstructions and steadier trajectories than recent state-of-the-art 3DGS-SLAM baselines while maintaining real-time performance ontractor. While demonstrated in orchard monitoring, the approach can be applied to other outdoor domains requiring
robust multimodal perception.
